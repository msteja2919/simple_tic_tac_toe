Title: Tic Tac Toe Game

Description:

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O', with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features:

Game Board: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of cells where players can place their symbols. Each cell initially starts empty.
Player Turns: Players take turns to play their moves. The game starts with Player 1 (X) and alternates between Player 1 and Player 2 (O) until the game is won or drawn.
Winning Condition: The game detects when a player has achieved a winning combination, i.e., when they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. When a player wins, the game displays a message announcing the winner and stops further gameplay.
Draw Condition: If all cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw, and it displays a message indicating that the game ended in a draw.
Reset Option: After the game ends (either by a win or draw), players have the option to reset the game and start over.
Implementation:

HTML: Provides the structure of the game board, including the grid layout of cells, messages for win/draw, and buttons for gameplay control.
CSS: Styles the game elements, such as the appearance of the cells, board layout, messages, and buttons, to enhance the visual appeal of the game.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including handling player clicks, updating the game state, checking for a winner or draw, and resetting the game when needed. JavaScript dynamically updates the HTML elements to reflect the current state of the game.
User Interaction:

Players interact with the game by clicking on the empty cells of the game board to place their symbols. The game responds to player actions by updating the board state, checking for a win or draw condition, and displaying appropriate messages accordingly. Players can also reset the game at any time to start a new game.

Overall, the Tic Tac Toe game offers a simple yet engaging experience, perfect for players of all ages to enjoy either solo or with a friend.
